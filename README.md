## Customer Sentiment Analysis


 For an IT company in technical support team , the employee has to  deal with different issues
from various customer in a daily basis. They’re using ticketing system and live chat to
communicate with customers. Customer feedback is very import to them – When They see positive
feedbacks, They know Their service is good and They may be able to expand their business with them.
When they see negative feedbacks,they need to take action to understand the reason and
address customer’s concerns timely.

So, They need to carefully monitor customer’s sentiment in all communications between their
support engineers and customers. Basically, They want to do at least two things 1) track
customer’s satisfaction level over times and give action suggestions; 2) real time monitor
ongoing communications and raise alarms when necessary.

However,  company’s data cannot be shared in public. So, this project will be using similar
data - “Customer Support on Twitter” dataset from Kaggle. And according to the effort and
limited time of this course, this project will focus on the first task “track customer’s satisfaction
level over times and give action suggestions”.
